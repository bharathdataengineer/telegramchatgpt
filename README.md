# ChatGPT Telegram Bot Integration with Python and AWS EC2

## Introduction

This repository provides a guide on how to integrate the OpenAI's ChatGPT language model with a Telegram bot and run the code on an AWS EC2 instance. The integration will allow users to interact with the ChatGPT model through a Telegram bot.

## Prerequisites

1. A Telegram account and a bot. You can create a bot by talking to the BotFather on Telegram.
2. An AWS account and an EC2 instance. You can create an EC2 instance by following the instructions in the AWS documentation.
3. A Python environment with the following packages installed on the EC2 instance:
   - `python-telegram-bot`: To communicate with the Telegram bot API
   - `openai`: To access the ChatGPT model

## Steps

1. Clone the repository or download the `chatgpt-tele.py` file.

2. Create a `config.ini` file and store the Telegram bot's API key and the ChatGPT model's API key in the following format:

   [DEFAULT]
   TELEGRAM_API_KEY = your_telegram_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_api_key
   
3. Copy the `chatgpt-tele.py` file and the `config.ini` to the EC2 instance. You can use the following command to transfer the file from your local machine to the EC2 instance:

   scp chatgpt-tele.py config.ini ec2-user@ec2-instance-ip:/home/ec2-user

4. Connect to the EC2 instance using the following command:

   ssh ec2-user@ec2-instance-ip


5. Run the `chatgpt-tele.py` file with the following command:

   python chatgpt-tele.py


6. Start a conversation with the Telegram bot and test the integration by sending a message to the bot. The bot should respond with a message generated by the ChatGPT model.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a simple and straightforward way to integrate the OpenAI's ChatGPT language model with a Telegram bot and run the code on an AWS EC2 instance. With this integration, users can interact with the model through a Telegram bot and get personalized responses to their queries.
